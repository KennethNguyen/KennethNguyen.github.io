# My Personal Website

## [kenneth.engineer](https://kenneth.engineer)

## Description

This is my own website I made as a portfolio to display my work, to talk about myself, and to reflect my interests. This was one of my first big projects in web development when I only knew HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML was used to create the nav bar section placed on the left of the page on medium and large viewports. This will be changed to be responsive to be at the top with a dropdown menu option for small viewports. I used JavaScript DOM manipulation to create nearly all the other content on this website and I used CSS to create a visual layout that I see fit.

## Color Palette
For my major redesign of my website, I decided to have a dedicated color palette to have the colors on the website be more consistent and compliment one another better than my previous design. I found a post proclaiming the [world's most popular colors for 2020](https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/worlds-most-popular-colors-2020/) and I thought "why not experiment with all of the colors on that list?". I went with Cosmic Latte; number 8 on that list and the hex code is #FFF9E3. I loved the look of the neutral tone on the background and it made me feel like the attention was more focused on the content this way. After choosing the main color, I looked for a similar color palette to compliment the main color for other elements on the website. I found [oat milk latte color palette](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/84733) and worked with that.
