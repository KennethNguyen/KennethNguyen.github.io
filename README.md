# My Personal Website

## [kenneth.engineer](https://kenneth.engineer)

## Description

This is my own website I made as a portfolio to display my work, to talk about myself, and to reflect my interests. This was one of my first big projects in web development when I only knew HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML was used to create the nav bar section placed on the left of the page on medium and large viewports. This will be changed to be responsive to be at the top with a dropdown menu option for small viewports. I used JavaScript DOM manipulation to create nearly all the other content on this website and I used CSS to create a visual layout that I see fit.

## Skills

* HTML | CSS | JavaScript
