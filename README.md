# My Personal Website

## [KennethNguyen.me](https://KennethNguyen.me)

## Description

This is my own website I made as a portfolio to display my work, to talk about myself, and to reflect my interests. I used Javascript DOM manipulation to create nearly all of the content on this website and I used CSS to create a layout that I see fit.

## Todo

I am still adding onto this website and looking into: 

* Refactoring code to have clean code and be more organized
* ~~Make clickable links more intuitive that they are clickable~~
* Scalable elements to size of window (website)
* Add more content to Projects section and About Me section
* Update CSS for grid/flex elements

## Skills

HTML | CSS | Javascript

No frameworks or bootstrap
